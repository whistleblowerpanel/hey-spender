# AVIF Conversion Removal Summary

## Overview

The AVIF conversion feature has been completely removed from the HeySpender project to simplify the image upload system and resolve production upload issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Vite Plugin Updates (`vite-plugin-file-upload.js`)
- ✅ Removed `sharp` import and dependency
- ✅ Removed AVIF conversion logic
- ✅ Simplified file saving to write files directly without conversion
- ✅ Files now maintain their original format and extension

### 2. Image Service Updates (`src/lib/wishlistService.js`)
- ✅ Updated `uploadCoverImage()` to use original file extensions
- ✅ Updated `uploadItemImage()` to use original file extensions
- ✅ Added production environment detection
- ✅ Added user-friendly error message for production uploads
- ✅ Removed AVIF-specific comments and logic

### 3. Component Updates
- ✅ Updated `AddOccasionModal.jsx` to use `imageService` instead of direct API calls
- ✅ Removed AVIF-specific filename generation
- ✅ Added proper import for `imageService`

### 4. Documentation Updates (`docs/LOCAL_MEDIA_UPLOAD.md`)
- ✅ Removed references to AVIF conversion
- ✅ Updated file storage description
- ✅ Updated implementation details
- ✅ Updated supported file types description

### 5. UI Updates (`src/components/forms/ImageUploadField.jsx`)
- ✅ Updated file type description to include GIF
- ✅ Removed AVIF-specific messaging

### 6. Dependencies
- ✅ Removed `sharp` package from `package.json`
- ✅ Uninstalled `sharp` from `node_modules`

## File Naming Convention

Files are now named using the original format:
```
{userId}-{timestamp}.{originalExtension}
```

Examples:
- `1a727d42-4357-44f7-b87a-bb23983f153a-1759519109142.jpeg`
- `temp-user-id-1759856876944.png`
- `user123-1759856876944.webp`

## Supported File Types

The system now accepts and stores all standard image formats in their original format:
- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- WebP
- GIF

## Production Behavior

In production environments:
- Upload attempts will show a user-friendly error message
- Users are directed to use existing images or contact support
- No more JSON parsing errors or unexpected token errors

## Development Behavior

In development:
- Uploads work normally through the Vite plugin
- Files are saved directly to `public/HeySpender Media/General/`
- No conversion processing, faster uploads

## Benefits of Removal

1. **Simplified Architecture**: No complex image processing pipeline
2. **Faster Uploads**: Direct file saving without conversion
3. **Better Production UX**: Clear error messages instead of cryptic JSON errors
4. **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed heavy `sharp` package
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Less complex code to maintain

## Migration Notes

- Existing AVIF files in the media folder will continue to work
- New uploads will use original formats
- No database changes required
- All existing functionality preserved

## Testing

- ✅ Development uploads tested and working
- ✅ Production error handling tested
- ✅ No linting errors introduced
- ✅ All components updated consistently

## Next Steps

For production upload functionality, consider:
1. Setting up a backend API endpoint
2. Using a third-party service (Cloudinary, AWS S3)
3. Implementing serverless functions for uploads
4. Adding authentication to upload endpoints

The current implementation provides a clean fallback for production while maintaining full functionality in development.
